* Storage Deployment Optimization Model (SDOM)
The high-temporal- and high-spatial-resolution grid planning framework SDOM is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model. SDOM minimizes the total power system capital and operational cost for a given carbon-free or renewable energy target—e.g., an 80% renewable energy share—for a 1-year operation window assuming no transmission constraints, e.g., copper plate approach. Note that a multiyear analysis could be more appropriate. For instance, simulation-based multiyear analyses allow for the assessment of the impacts of interannual variability of VRE generation and load on storage requirements; however, multiyear chronological optimization analyses with hourly resolution are computationally challenging—based on current computing capabilities—and therefore it is left for future work.
